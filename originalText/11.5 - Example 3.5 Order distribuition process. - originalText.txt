A company has two warehouses that store different products: Amsterdam and Hamburg.
When an order is received, it is distributed across these warehouses: if some of the relevant
products are maintained in Amsterdam, a sub-order is sent there; likewise, if some relevant
products are maintained in Hamburg, a sub-order is sent there. Afterwards, the order is
registered and the process completes.
