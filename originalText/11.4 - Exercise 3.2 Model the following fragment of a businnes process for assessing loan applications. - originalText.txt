A loan application is approved if it passes two checks: (i) the applicants loan risk assessment,
done automatically by a system, and (ii) the appraisal of the property for which the
loan has been asked, carried out by a property appraiser. 
The risk assessment requires a credit history check on the applicant, which is performed by a financial officer. Once both
the loan risk assessment and the property appraisal have been performed, a loan officer can
assess the applicant's eligibility. If the applicant is not eligible, the application is rejected,
otherwise the acceptance pack is prepared and sent to the applicant.
