In a stock exchange, stock price variations are continuously monitored during the day. A day
starts when the opening bell rings and concludes when the closing bell rings. Between the
two bells, every time the stock price changes by more than 10%, the entity of the change is
first determined. Next, if the change is high, a "high stock price" alert is sent, otherwise a
"low stock price" alert is sent.
