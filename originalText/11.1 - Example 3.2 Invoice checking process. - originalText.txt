As soon as an invoice is received from a customer, it needs to be checked for mismatches.
The check may result in either of these three options: i) there are no mismatches, in which
case the invoice is posted; ii) there are mismatches but these can be corrected, in which
case the invoice is re-sent to the customer; and iii) there are mismatches but these cannot
be corrected, in which case the invoice is blocked. Once one of these three activities is
performed the invoice is parked and the process completes.
