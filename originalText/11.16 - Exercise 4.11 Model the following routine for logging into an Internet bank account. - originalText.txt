The routine for logging into an Internet bank account starts once the credentials entered
from the user have been retrieved. First, the username is validated. If the username is not
valid, the routine is interrupted and the invalid username is logged. If the username is valid,
the number of password trials is set to zero. Then the password is validated. If this is not
valid, the counter for the number of trials is incremented and if lower than three, the user
is asked to enter the password again, this time together with a CAPTCHA test to increase
the security level. If the number of failed attempts reaches three times, the routine is interrupted
and the account is frozen. Moreover, the username and password validation may
be interrupted should the validation server not be available. Similarly, the server to test the
CAPTCHA may not be available at the time of log in. In these cases, the procedure is interrupted
after notifying the user to try again later. At any time during the log in routine, the
customer may close the web-page, resulting in the interruption of the routine.
