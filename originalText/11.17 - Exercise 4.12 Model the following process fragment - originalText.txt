Once a wholesale order has been confirmed, the supplier transmits this order to the carrier
for the preparation of the transportation quote. In order to prepare the quote, the carrier
needs to compute the route plan (including all track points that need to be traversed
during the travel) and estimate the trailer usage (e.g. whether it is a full track-load, half
track-load or a single package). By contract, wholesale orders have to be dispatched within
four days from the receipt of the order. This implies that transportation quotes have to be
prepared within 48 hours from the receipt of the order to remain within the terms of the
contract.
