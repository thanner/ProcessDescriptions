A typical army recruitment process starts by shortlisting all candidates applications. Those
shortlisted are then called to sit the following tests: drug and alcohol, eye, color vision,
hearing, blood, urine, weight, fingerprinting and doctor examination. The color vision can
only be done after the eye test, while the doctor examination can only be done after color
vision, hearing, blood, urine and weight have been tested. Moreover, it may be required
for some candidates to repeat some of these tests multiple times in order to get a correct
assessment, e.g. the blood test may need to be repeated if the candidate has taken too much
sugar in the previous 24 hours. The candidates that pass all tests are asked to sit a mental
exam and a physical exam, followed by an interview. Only those that also pass these two
exams and perform well in the interview can be recruited in the army.
