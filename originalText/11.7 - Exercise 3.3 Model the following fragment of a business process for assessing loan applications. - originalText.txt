A loan application may be coupled with a home insurance which is offered at discounted
prices. The applicant may express their interest in a home insurance plan at the time of
submitting their loan application to the loan provider. Based on this information, if the
loan application is approved, the loan provider may either only send an acceptance pack
to the applicant, or also send a home insurance quote. The process then continues with the
verification of the repayment agreement.
