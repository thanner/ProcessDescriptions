Once a loan application is received by the loan provider, and before proceeding with its
assessment, the application itself needs to be checked for completeness. If the application is
incomplete, it is returned to the applicant, so that they can fill out the missing information
and send it back to the loan provider. This process is repeated until the application is found
complete.
