The order fulfillment process is carried out by a seller's organization which includes two departments:
the sales department and the warehouse & distribution department. The purchase
order received by warehouse & distribution is checked against the stock. This operation is
carried out automatically by the ERP system of warehouse & distribution, which queries
the warehouse database. If the product is in stock, it is retrieved from the warehouse before
sales confirm the order. Next sales emit an invoice and wait for the payment, while the
product is shipped from within warehouse & distribution. The process completes with the
order archival in the sales department. If the product is not in stock, the ERP system within
warehouse & distribution checks the raw materials availability by accessing the suppliers
catalog. Once the raw materials have been obtained the warehouse & distribution department
takes care of manufacturing the product. The process completes with the purchase
order being confirmed and archived by the sales department.
