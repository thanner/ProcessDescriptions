In the treasury minister's office, once a ministerial inquiry has been received, it is first
registered into the system. Then the inquiry is investigated so that a ministerial response
can be prepared. The finalization of a response includes the preparation of the response
itself by the cabinet officer and the review of the response by the principal registrar. If the
registrar does not approve the response, the latter needs to be prepared again by the cabinet
officer for review. The process finishes only once the response has been approved.
