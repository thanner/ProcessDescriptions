The ISP sends an invoice by email to the customer on the first working day of each month
(Day 1). On Day 7, the customer has the full outstanding amount automatically debited
from their bank account. If an automatic transaction fails for any reason, the customer
is notified on Day 8. On Day 9, the transaction that failed on Day 7 is re-attempted. If
it fails again, on Day 10 a late fee is charged to the customer's bank account. At this
stage, the automatic payment is no longer attempted. On Day 14, the Internet service is
suspended until payment is received. If on Day 30 the payment is still outstanding, the
account is closed and a disconnection fee is applied. A debt-recovery procedure is then
started.
