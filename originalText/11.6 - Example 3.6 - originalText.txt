If the product requested is not in stock, it needs to bemanufactured before the order handling
can continue. To manufacture a product, the required raw materials have to be ordered. Two
preferred suppliers provide different types of raw material. Depending on the product to
be manufactured, raw materials may be ordered from either Supplier 1 or Supplier 2, or
from both. Once the raw materials are available, the product can be manufactured and the
order can be confirmed. On the other hand, if the product is in stock, it is retrieved from the
warehouse before confirming the order. Then the process continues normally.
