After an Expense report is received from an employee, the employee is notified of the
receipt of the report. Next, a new account must be created if the employee does not already
have one. The report is then reviewed for automatic approval. Amounts under $1,000 are
automatically approved while amounts equal to or over $1,000 require manual approval.
In case of rejection, the employee must receive a Rejection notice by email. In case of
approval, the reimbursement is deposited directly to the employee's bank account. At any
time during the review, the employee can send a Request for amount rectification. In that
case the rectification is registered and the report needs to be reviewed again. Moreover, if
the report is not handled within 30 days, the process is stopped and the employee receives
a Cancelation notice email so that he can re-submit the expense report from scratch.
